## d3Kit

d3Kit is a set of tools to speed [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) related project development. 
It is a lightweight library (~8KB, minified) to help you do the basic groundwork tasks you need when building visualization with d3.
d3Kit features include, but are not limited to:

* Setup ```<svg>``` according to d3's [margin convention](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3019563) and support auto-resizing. We called it a "Skeleton" for your visualization.
* Help you create reusable component.
* Help you create reusable subcomponent (a.k.a. Chartlet).
* and many more...

Here are a few examples of d3Kit in action:
* [Dot in a box](http://bl.ocks.org/treboresque/f839966214cf66627df6)
* [Bubble Chart](http://bl.ocks.org/kristw/75999459f1a34e05d580)
