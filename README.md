## d3Kit

d3Kit is a set of tools to speed [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) related project development. 
It is a lightweight library (~8KB, minified) to help you do the basic groundwork tasks you need when building vis with d3.
Groundwork tasks include, but are not limited to:

* Setup the chart according to d3's [margin convention](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3019563)
* Support auto-resizing
* and many more...

Here are a few examples of d3Kit in action:
* [Dot in a box](http://bl.ocks.org/treboresque/f839966214cf66627df6)
* [Bubble Chart](http://bl.ocks.org/kristw/75999459f1a34e05d580)
